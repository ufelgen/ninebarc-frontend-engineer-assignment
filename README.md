## Objective

Build a simple web application that allows users to search for books using the Open Library API and display the search results. Users should be able to select a book from the search results to view more details about the book.

## Requirements

- Use React and Redux to build the application.
- Use the Open Library API to search for books. The API documentation can be found here: `https://openlibrary.org/developers/api`.
- Display the search results as a list of books with their titles, authors and cover images.
- When a user clicks on a book from the search results, display more details about the book, including its title, author, cover image, publication date, and a brief description.
- Write unit tests for your components using Jest.

## Evaluation Criteria

- The code should be well-organized and maintainable.
- The application should be responsive and easy to use.
- The Redux store should be used to manage the state of the application.
- The application should handle errors gracefully and display meaningful error messages to the user.
- The unit tests should be comprehensive and cover all important functionality.

## Bonus

- Allow users to add books to a "favorites" list.
- Add pagination to the search results if there are more than 20 results.
- Use TailwindCSS to style the application.

## Submission

- The interviewee should provide a GitHub repository containing the code for the application, along with instructions for running the application locally and running the tests. The repository should also include a README.md file with a brief overview of the application and any additional notes or comments the interviewee would like to provide.
